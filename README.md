I am pleased and delighted to announce that we students of KARNATAKA are part of this remarkable initiative by Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR) and VLSI System Design (VSD) under the RISC-V Mission 2025. This nation-building effort aims to create a skilled workforce of 1,000 RISC-V engineers across Karnataka, contributing to the vision of Digital India.
Here’s what makes this program a game-changer:
1. 6-Week Training Program: A focused, hands-on cohort designed to equip participants with practical knowledge in RISC-V and semiconductor technologies.
2. 2. Perfect for Campus Aspirants: Specifically tailored for engineering students preparing for interviews, with a passion for entering the semiconductor industry.
3. FREE RISC-V Development Boards: VSD provides all participants with the right tools to empower innovation.

I sincerely thank Samsung Semiconductor India Research and VLSI System Design for giving us this incredible opportunity to explore and excel. This initiative inspires innovation and builds a strong foundation for students to become leaders in the semiconductor industry.
It’s an honour to contribute to this transformative mission and take a step toward becoming future RISC-V innovators.
